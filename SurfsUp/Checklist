Part 1: ANALYZE AND EXPLORE THE CLIMATE

In this section, you’ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, you’ll use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. To do so, complete the following steps:

<!-- 1. Note that you’ll use the provided files (climate_starter.ipynb and hawaii.sqlite) to complete your climate analysis and data exploration. -->

<!-- 2. Use the SQLAlchemy create_engine() function to connect to your SQLite database. -->

3. Use the SQLAlchemy automap_base() function to reflect your tables into classes, and then save references to the classes named station and measurement.

4. Link Python to the database by creating a SQLAlchemy session.

-----IMPORTANT------
Remember to close your session at the end of your notebook.

5. Perform a precipitation analysis and then a station analysis by completing the steps in the following two subsections.
